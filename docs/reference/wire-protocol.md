# Wire Protocol

The foundational contract in MikanXR: every struct and enum in `src/Libraries/MikanClientAPI` and `src/Libraries/MikanClientCore` is the wire protocol. Changing one changes what crosses the websocket between `Mikan.exe` and every client, and changes the generated C#/TypeScript bindings under `bindings/`. This doc covers the contract libraries, the Refureku reflection and codegen pipeline, the serialization layer and its traps, the server-side request routing, the property schema contract and its guard test, and the out-of-band shared texture path. See [modules.md](./modules.md) for the surrounding architecture, [build.md](./build.md) for how the codegen targets fit into the build, and [standards.md](./standards.md) for general coding rules.

## The contract libraries

Two DLLs define everything that crosses the process boundary:

- `src/Libraries/MikanClientCore` is the low-level client. A C API (`Public/MikanCoreCAPI.h`: `Mikan_Initialize`, `Mikan_Connect`, `Mikan_SendRequestJSON`, `Mikan_FetchNextEvent`, render target texture functions) plus the core types and enums in `Public/MikanCoreTypes.h` (`MikanCoreResult`, `MikanClientGraphicsApi`, `MikanRenderTargetDescriptor`, ...).

- `src/Libraries/MikanClientAPI`: the typed C++ API. `Public/MikanAPI.h` declares `IMikanAPI` (`connect`, `sendRequest`, `fetchNextEvent`). The rest of `Public/` is one header per domain holding the request/response/event structs and shared value types: `Mikan*Requests.h`, `Mikan*Events.h`, `Mikan*Types.h` (camera, stencil, stage, marker, light, property, script, shape, texture source, video source, remote control, ...).

Base types live in `Public/MikanAPITypes.h`: `MikanRequest` (`requestTypeName`, `requestId`), `MikanResponse` (`responseTypeName`, `requestId`, `resultCode`), `MikanEvent` (`eventTypeName`). Every concrete request/response/event derives from one of these.

Rules that follow from this being the wire contract:

- The wire type name of a message is the C++ struct name. Each struct's constructor stamps its type-name field via `MIKAN_REQUEST_TYPE_INFO_INIT` / `MIKAN_RESPONSE_TYPE_INFO_INIT` / `MIKAN_EVENT_TYPE_INFO_INIT`, which read `staticGetArchetype().getName()` from Refureku. Renaming a struct renames the message on the wire.

- Enum values must stay numerically stable across versions. `MikanAPIResult` in `MikanAPITypes.h` says so explicitly, and its low range must stay in sync with `MikanCoreResult` in `MikanCoreTypes.h`.

- Strings in these structs are `Serialization::String`, never `std::string` (see the serialization section).

---

## Refureku annotations

Both libraries (and `MikanSerialization`) are annotated for Refureku, a C++ static reflection generator that runs at build time. The pattern, from `Public/MikanStencilRequests.h`:

```cpp
struct MIKAN_API STRUCT(Serialization::CodeGenModule("MikanStencilRequest")) GetModelStencilRenderGeometry
    : public MikanRequest
{
public:
    GetModelStencilRenderGeometry() { MIKAN_REQUEST_TYPE_INFO_INIT(GetModelStencilRenderGeometry) }

    FIELD() MikanStencilID stencilId= INVALID_MIKAN_ID;

#ifdef MIKANAPI_REFLECTION_ENABLED
    GetModelStencilRenderGeometry_GENERATED
#endif
};
```

Enums follow the same shape (`MikanAPITypes.h`):

```cpp
enum class ENUM(Serialization::CodeGenModule("MikanAPITypes")) MikanAPIResult
{
    Success ENUMVALUE_STRING("Success")= 0,
    ...
};
```

The moving parts:

- `STRUCT(...)` / `ENUM(...)` / `FIELD()` / `CLASS()` are the Refureku parse markers. Only marked entities are reflected (the `shouldParseAll*` flags in `RefurekuSettings.toml` are false, except enum values).

- `Serialization::CodeGenModule("Name")` (defined in `MikanSerialization/Public/SerializationProperty.h`) is an `rfk::Property` that tags the entity with an output-module name. The codegen tool groups types by this tag; one tag becomes one generated `.cs`/`.ts` file.

- Each header includes its generated `<Name>.rfkh.h` and ends with `File_<Name>_GENERATED`; each struct body carries `<Name>_GENERATED`. These expand to the reflection metadata.

- Each library has a `RefurekuSettings.toml` listing exactly which headers are parsed (`toProcessFiles`) and where generated files go (`build/RfkGenerated/<LibraryName>`). A new header with wire types must be added to that list or it is invisible to reflection and codegen.

- CMake runs the generator before compiling: `src/Libraries/MikanClientAPI/CMakeLists.txt` defines a `MikanClientAPIReflection` custom target that runs `RefurekuGenerator.exe` on the toml, and `MikanClientAPI` depends on it. `MikanClientCore` and `MikanSerialization` follow the same pattern.

---

## Codegen pipeline: C++ to C# and TypeScript

`src/Programs/ClientCodeGen/ClientCodeGen.cpp` builds `MikanClientCodeGen.exe`. It links against the reflected `MikanClientCore`/`MikanClientAPI`/`MikanSerialization` DLLs, walks the runtime Refureku database (`rfk::Struct`, `rfk::Enum`), buckets every entity by its `Serialization::CodeGenModule` property, and emits equivalent types per module.

How it runs (all wired in CMake, not manual):

- `bindings/csharp/CMakeLists.txt` defines the custom target `MikanCSharpCodeGen`, which runs `MikanClientCodeGen` with `bindings/csharp/CSharpCodeGenConfig.json` (`"output_path": "Generated"`). The `MikanClientCSharp` project depends on it, so building the C# bindings regenerates first. C# only builds under the Visual Studio generator (the project is `LANGUAGES CSharp`), so it is skipped under Ninja and in CI.

- `bindings/typescript/CMakeLists.txt` defines `MikanTypeScriptCodeGen`, which runs the tool with `TypescriptCodeGenConfig.json` (`"output_path": "types"`), then `MikanTypeScriptNpmInstall` (`npm install`), then `MikanClientTypeScript` (`npm run build`) compile to `dist/`.

The generated outputs are checked into git (`bindings/csharp/CMakeLists.txt` carries a TODO about removing that need). This creates the hard rule:

**Never hand-edit `bindings/csharp/Generated/` or `bindings/typescript/types/`.** They are overwritten by the next codegen run. To change a client-facing type, edit the C++ header in `MikanClientAPI`/`MikanClientCore`, rebuild, and let `MikanCSharpCodeGen` / `MikanTypeScriptCodeGen` regenerate. The hand-written runtime around the generated types (`bindings/csharp/MikanAPI.cs`, `bindings/typescript/MikanClient.ts`, the `Serialization/` folders) is editable.

## Message flow over the websocket

`src/Editor/Interprocess/WebsocketInterprocessMessageServer` hosts the socket (IXWebSocket, `ws://127.0.0.1`, port `8080`, protocol prefix `Mikan-`, all `#define`d in `InterprocessMessageServerInterface.h`).

- Requests are JSON text frames. `WebsocketInterprocessMessageServer::processRequests` SAX-scans the incoming string for `requestTypeName` and dispatches to the handler registered under that exact name; `requestId` is optional (fire-and-forget when absent). An unregistered type name gets a plain `MikanResponse` with `MikanAPIResult::UnknownFunction`.

- Responses fill a `ClientResponse` with either `utf8String` (sent as a text frame) or `binaryData` (sent as a binary frame). Binary responses use the `BinarySerializer` path; JSON responses use `Serialization::serializeToJsonString`.

- Events are server-to-client JSON pushes. `MikanServer::publishMikanJsonEvent` fans a serialized `MikanEvent` subclass out to every connection. Clients poll them off a queue via `IMikanAPI::fetchNextEvent` / `Mikan_FetchNextEvent`; there is no per-event acknowledgement.

---

## Serialization layer and its traps

`src/Libraries/MikanSerialization` walks reflected structs generically: `JsonSerializer`/`JsonDeserializer` (nlohmann-backed) for the websocket and config files, `BinarySerializer`/`BinaryDeserializer` for binary response payloads, with `SerializationVisitor` as the shared field-visiting core and `Serialization::List`/`Map`/`PolymorphicObjectPtr`/`String` as the reflected container types. `TypeRegistry::buildFromRfkDatabase` must run at startup before deserializing polymorphic objects by type name (both `MikanServer` clients and `CmdApp::exec` do this).

Two traps, both real and both verified in code:

**1. `Serialization::String` is `const char*`-only. Do not widen it.** `Public/SerializableString.h` exposes only `const char*` (`setUtf8Value`/`getUtf8Value`, `const char*` constructor and assignment) and hides `std::string` in a pimpl. The header comment states why: `std::string` memory layout differs between Debug and Release CRTs, so passing it across a DLL boundary built against a different CRT (the Unreal plugin uses the Release CRT) corrupts the data. Bytes are always UTF-8; convert at the ingestion boundary. Keep the interface `const char*` even though `std::string` would be more convenient.

**2. The `const char*` to `bool` overload trap in `to_binary`.** `Public/BinaryUtility.h` declares `to_binary(BinaryWriter&, bool)` and `to_binary(BinaryWriter&, const Serialization::String&)` but no `const char*` overload. Passing a raw `const char*` therefore binds the `bool` overload: pointer-to-bool is a standard conversion, which beats the user-defined `const char*` to `Serialization::String` conversion in overload resolution. The string silently serializes as one byte of `true`. When writing `to_binary`/`from_binary` overloads for a new type, wrap C strings in `Serialization::String` (or `std::string`) explicitly before serializing.

## Server side: MikanServer and request handlers

`src/Editor/Server/MikanServer` owns the `WebsocketInterprocessMessageServer` (plus an `HttpInterprocessMessageServer` for HTTP triggers) and a fixed set of per-domain handlers constructed in its constructor: `CameraRequestHandler`, `FunctionRequestHandler`, `LightRequestHandler`, `PropertyRequestHandler`, `MarkerRequestHandler`, `ScriptRequestHandler`, `ShapeRequestHandler`, `StencilRequestHandler`, `TextureSourceRequestHandler`, `VideoSourceRequestHandler`, and the `RemoteControlManager`. `MikanServer` itself only handles connection lifecycle (`InitClientRequest`/`DisposeClientRequest`).

Each handler derives from `IServerRequestHandler` (`src/Editor/Server/IServerRequestHandler.h`) and, in its `startup`, registers each request type by reflected name:

```cpp
messageServer->setRequestHandler(GetVideoSourceMode::staticGetArchetype().getName(), ...);
```

Recipe for a new remote-controllable capability (do not modify request routing in `MikanServer` beyond construction/startup wiring):

1. Define the request/response structs in a `MikanClientAPI/Public` header, annotated with `STRUCT(Serialization::CodeGenModule(...))` and `FIELD()`, with the `MIKAN_*_TYPE_INFO_INIT` constructor macro. Add the header to `RefurekuSettings.toml` if new.
2. Add (or extend) an `IServerRequestHandler` in `src/Editor/Server` that registers the type names and implements the behavior, and wire it into `MikanServer`'s constructor/`startup` if it is a new handler class.
3. Rebuild and regenerate the C#/TypeScript bindings.

`RemoteControlManager` plus `IRemoteControllable` (`handleRemoteControlCommand`, `sendRemoteControlEvent`) is the string-command channel objects implement to be remotely driven; the structured "properties" system on top is served by `PropertyRequestHandler` (`PropertyGetValueRequest`, `PropertySetValueRequest`, `GetPropertyDescriptors`, `ComponentGetValuesRequest`, `GetComponentListRequest`, `SystemGetValuesRequest`, ...).

---

## The property contract and its guard test

A client-facing property must be wired consistently in three places:

1. **Values struct**: the `Mikan*Values` struct in `MikanClientAPI` (e.g. `MikanAnchorComponentValues` in `MikanAnchorTypes.h`) with a `FIELD()` per property. This is what `ComponentGetValuesRequest`/`SystemGetValuesRequest` return, filled generically by `Serialization::serializeFromEntity` (`src/Editor/Server/ServerEntitySerializer.cpp`), whose `EntityAccessorReadVisitor` maps each field type to a required `MikanVariantType`.
2. **Descriptor**: the class's static `getPropertyDescriptors` must advertise a `PropertyDescriptor` (`src/Editor/ECS/PropertyInterface.h`) with the same name and the exact `MikanVariantType` the serializer demands. Descriptors default to `isClientAPIHidden() == true`; a descriptor left hidden is invisible to clients and exempt from the field check.
3. **`getPropertyValue`**: the component/system's `IPropertyInterface::getPropertyValue` must answer for that name with a `MikanVariant` of that type, since `EntityAccessorReadVisitor` fills every values-struct field by calling it.

The guard test is `src/Editor/Server/Test/ClientApiPropertySchemaTests.cpp`, run from `CmdApp::runTests` via `MikanCmd.exe -runTests` (see [commands.md](./commands.md)). For every entry in `k_schemaTestEntries` (each `SCHEMA_ENTRY(EditorClass, ValuesStruct)` pair, covering all components and object systems) it:

- instantiates the values struct via reflection and walks it with `PropertySchemaVisitor`, a deliberate mirror of `EntityAccessorReadVisitor`, computing the `MikanVariantType` the serializer will demand per field (failing on unsupported field types);
- fails if any values-struct field has no non-hidden descriptor of the exact same name and type;
- fails if any non-hidden descriptor has no matching values-struct field.

What it cannot check is leg 3: a `getPropertyValue` that ignores a name fails only at runtime (the field stays default-valued). So when adding a property: add the `FIELD()`, add the descriptor with matching name/type, implement `getPropertyValue` (and `setPropertyValue` if writable), and add a `SCHEMA_ENTRY` if the class is new. Then regenerate bindings, since the values struct changed the wire protocol.

## Out-of-band: video frames via shared textures

Rendered frames never travel over the websocket. Clients allocate shared render target textures through the core C API (`Mikan_AllocateCameraRenderTargetTextures` with a `MikanRenderTargetDescriptor`, then `Mikan_WriteCameraColorRenderTargetTexture` / `...Depth...` / `...Shadow...` per frame), backed by the `src/Libraries/MikanSharedTexture` library (`SharedTextureWriter.h`). On the editor side, `src/Editor/Interprocess/SharedTextureReader.h` (`SharedTextureReadAccessor`) opens the same shared textures by sender name and pulls color/depth/shadow into `IMkTexture`s when `readRenderTargetTextures` sees a new frame index. The websocket carries only the control traffic around this seam (the render-target requests in `MikanRenderTargetRequests.h` and frame events); pixels move through GPU shared texture memory. See [compositor.md](./compositor.md) for how the editor consumes these frames.

---

## Client side

A C++ client calls `IMikanAPI::createMikanAPI()`, `init(...)`, then `connect()` (defaults) or `connect(host, port)`, and drives everything through `sendRequest(MikanRequest&)`, which returns a `MikanResponseFuture` keyed by `requestId`. Events arrive by polling `fetchNextEvent(MikanEventPtr&)` each frame. The C# (`bindings/csharp/MikanAPI.cs`, `MikanRequestManager.cs`, `MikanEventManager.cs`) and TypeScript (`bindings/typescript/MikanClient.ts`, `MikanRequestManager.ts`, `MikanEventManager.ts`) runtimes mirror this shape over the same JSON protocol, using the generated types in `Generated/` and `types/` respectively. Under the hood all three serialize the request struct to JSON (with `requestTypeName` and `requestId`), send it as a websocket text frame, and match responses back to futures by `requestId`.
