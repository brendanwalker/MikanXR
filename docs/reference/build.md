# Build System

How MikanXR is configured and built: toolchain, dependency setup, CMake targets, the CI configuration, and build gotchas. Directory context is in [layout.md](./layout.md); a copy-paste command cheat sheet is in [commands.md](./commands.md).

---

## Toolchain

- Windows only in practice (Win10/11). The CMake files carry Linux/Darwin branches but the Windows-specific install/copy steps and prebuilt deps make MSVC the supported path.

- MSVC via Visual Studio 2022. CMake minimum 3.15 (`cmake_minimum_required` in the root `CMakeLists.txt`).

- C++20 (`CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20` in `cmake/Environment.cmake`), `/W4` with a suppression list, `/MP`, `NOMINMAX` and `_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS` defined globally.

- Project version is parsed out of `src/Editor/AppCore/Version.h` by `cmake/Version.cmake` (`MIKAN_RELEASE_VERSION_*` defines) into `MIKAN_VERSION_STRING`.

---

## First-time setup

`InitialSetup_x64.bat` (run from the repo root) deletes any existing `build/` and `deps/` folders, then downloads and unpacks prebuilt dependencies into `deps/` using `tools/7zip/7za.exe`: SDL2 2.30.10, SDL2_image 2.8.8, SDL2_ttf 2.24.0 (the devel zips, which carry the runtime DLLs; SDL2_ttf 2.24 statically links freetype so no separate `libfreetype-6.dll`/`zlib1.dll` ship anymore), OpenCV 4.10.0, GLEW 2.2.0, Spout2 2.007h, easy_profiler 2.1.0, Refureku (prebuilt `rfk` package, includes `RefurekuGenerator.exe`), libharu 2.4.5, CEF (Chromium 145 binary distribution), ONNX Runtime 1.20.1 (DirectML flavor) and DirectML 1.15.4 (both from NuGet packages), and `nuget.exe`.

The DirectML package ships every architecture at roughly 350MB. The script keeps only `bin/x64-win` and deletes the rest, which matters because CI caches `deps/` keyed on the hash of `InitialSetup_x64.bat`. ONNX Runtime backs the two ML capture tools through the `MikanOnnx` library: the scene lighting estimator ([scene-lighting.md](./scene-lighting.md)) and the depth proxy mesh capture ([depth-proxy-mesh.md](./depth-proxy-mesh.md)).

The model checkpoints those tools consume are not dependencies and `InitialSetup_x64.bat` does not fetch them. They live under a gitignored `models/` at the repo root and are produced by the Python tools in `tools/` (see [commands.md](./commands.md)).

GStreamer is different: the script downloads runtime and devel MSIs (1.26.10 mingw x86_64) and installs them system-wide via `msiexec`. Setting the environment variable `SKIP_GSTREAMER=1` skips both MSIs (CI does this).

Since the script wipes `build/` and `deps/`, rerun project generation afterwards.

## Configuring

`GenerateProjectFiles_X64_VS2022.bat` configures `build/` with `-G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64` and produces `build/Mikan.sln`. It passes the dependency locations as cache variables: `CEF_ROOT`, `OpenCV_DIR`, `OPENVR_ROOT_DIR`/`OPENVR_HEADERS_ROOT_DIR` (from `thirdparty/openvr`), the `SDL2*_LIBRARY`/`SDL2*_INCLUDE_DIR` pairs, `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` for easy_profiler, `NUGET_PATH`, `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=dist/Win64`, and `-DCMAKE_UNITY_BUILD=ON`.

Notable CMake options (defined in `cmake/ThirdParty.cmake` unless noted):

- `MIKAN_WITH_GSTREAMER` (default `ON`): gates the GStreamer `find_package` calls and the `MikanGStreamerVideo` plugin (`src/Plugins/CMakeLists.txt`), plus GStreamer-dependent unit tests. On the `iphone` branch it also gates `MikanARKitVideo`.

- `CMAKE_UNITY_BUILD`: on in both local and CI configurations; see the gotcha below.

- `CEF_ROOT`: defaults to the versioned folder under `deps/cef` if not given.

- `CUDA_PATH` (environment, `iphone` branch only): when set with GStreamer enabled, locates CUDA Toolkit headers for the ARKit plugin's CUDA-GL interop.

- `CLANG_FORMAT_EXE`: overrides clang-format discovery for the format targets.

Third-party source builds: `thirdparty/CMakeLists.txt` builds `fast_obj_lib`, `ixwebsocket`, and CEF's `libcef_dll_wrapper` (forced to `/MD` to match Mikan's dynamic CRT). `dylib` is fetched via `FetchContent` at configure time.

---

## Key targets

- `MikanEditor`: OBJECT library containing all `src/Editor` code, compiled once.

- `Mikan`: GUI executable (`WIN32` subsystem, `AppCore/EntryPoint.cpp`, embedded manifest so CEF subprocesses see the real OS version). Links `MikanEditor`.

- `MikanCmd`: console executable (`AppCore/CmdEntryPoint.cpp`), same editor object code; runs the editor unit test suite via `-runTests` and the headless ML capture commands (see [commands.md](./commands.md)). `add_dependencies(MikanCmd Mikan)` so the runtime DLL copies (attached only to `Mikan`) are present and never race.

- Library targets: one per `src/Libraries` subdirectory, `SHARED` except `MikanDMX` and `MikanOnnx`, which are `STATIC` (see [layout.md](./layout.md)).

- Plugin DLLs: `MikanWMFVideo`, `MikanSteamVR`, and (GStreamer builds only) `MikanGStreamerVideo`; the `iphone` branch adds `MikanARKitVideo` under the same gate. Each is a `SHARED` library compiled with `CXX_VISIBILITY_PRESET hidden` and its own `*_EXPORTS` define, then copied next to `Mikan.exe` by the `copy_mikan_runtime_deps` post-build step in `src/Editor/CMakeLists.txt` (along with SDL2, OpenCV, GLEW, Spout2, CEF, Lua, Refureku, easy_profiler, ONNX Runtime, and DirectML runtime DLLs).

- `MikanClientCodeGen`: bindings generator executable (`src/Programs/ClientCodeGen`).

- `MikanTypeScriptCodeGen` / `MikanCSharpCodeGen`: custom targets that run `MikanClientCodeGen` with `TypeScriptCodeGenConfig.json` / `CSharpCodeGenConfig.json`; the `MikanClientTypeScript` target then runs `npm install` and `npm run build`.

- `unit_test_suite_cpp`: C++ unit tests; its `unit_test_suite_reflection` dependency runs `RefurekuGenerator.exe` first. `MikanClientAPIReflection`, `MikanClientCoreReflection`, `MikanSerializationReflection` do the same for the reflected libraries.

- `FormatFix` / `FormatCheck`: clang-format wrappers (`cmake/ClangFormat.cmake`), both delegating to `cmake/RunClangFormat.cmake`.

- `CREATE_INSTALLER`: Inno Setup installer build (`cmake/Installer.cmake`); only created when Inno Setup is found. Uses `templates/installer_win64.iss.in`.

- `INSTALL`: installs exes, DLLs, and bindings into `dist/Win64`.

Output locations: under the VS generator, executables land in per-target config folders (`build\src\Editor\<Config>\Mikan.exe`, `build\src\Programs\Tests\UnitTests\<Config>\unit_test_suite_cpp.exe`). CI overrides this with `CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY=build\bin`.

---

## CI configuration

`.github/workflows/build-and-test.yml` has two jobs:

- `format-check` (Linux, no build tree): `pipx install clang-format==19.1.5`, then `cmake -P cmake/RunClangFormat.cmake -- --check`. The version is pinned to match the clang-format 19.1.x bundled with VS2022; other major versions format differently.

- `build` (windows-2022): initializes only the needed submodules, caches `deps/` keyed on the hash of `InitialSetup_x64.bat`, runs setup with `SKIP_GSTREAMER=1`, and configures with the Ninja generator instead of Visual Studio. Ninja is used specifically so `CMAKE_C/CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=sccache` takes effect (the VS/MSBuild generator ignores compiler launchers). Key configure differences from local:

```
-G "Ninja" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
-DMIKAN_WITH_GSTREAMER=OFF
-DCMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY=%GITHUB_WORKSPACE%\build\bin
-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=sccache -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=sccache
-DCEF_DEBUG_INFO_FLAG=/Z7
-DCMAKE_UNITY_BUILD=ON
```

CI then builds `MikanCmd` and `unit_test_suite_cpp`, runs `build\bin\MikanCmd.exe -runTests` (dumping `MikanCmd.log` afterwards) and `build\bin\unit_test_suite_cpp.exe`, and uploads `build\bin` as an artifact on `main` pushes.

---

## Gotchas

- Unity build: `CMAKE_UNITY_BUILD=ON` concatenates unrelated translation units, so a transitively included `windows.h` can rewrite a same-named method via macro (e.g. `GetObject` becomes `GetObjectA`) and produce an `LNK2019` far from the actual conflict. Avoid method names that collide with Win32 macros (`GetObject`, `SendMessage`, `CreateWindow`, ...). Files with inclusion-order problems are opted out via `SKIP_UNITY_BUILD_INCLUSION` in `src/Editor/CMakeLists.txt`.

- C# is only supported by Visual Studio generators. `bindings/csharp` and `src/Programs/Tests/MikanClientTestCSharp` are skipped under Ninja (`if(CMAKE_GENERATOR MATCHES "Visual Studio")` in `bindings/CMakeLists.txt` and `src/Programs/Tests/CMakeLists.txt`), so CI never builds them.

- The TypeScript binding targets require `npm` on PATH; if it is missing, configuration emits a warning and skips them.

- Refureku generated headers land in `build/RfkGenerated/<Library>`; the `*Reflection` custom targets regenerate them before each dependent build.
